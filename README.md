Ideas for this bot:
1. keeps track of assigned Inspiration Points
   1. when they were given, and a brief description of why
2. Last sessions "exit" notes, to serve as a briefing for when starting the next session.
2. Users birthdays on the server
   1.implementation for this might best be left to the servers themselves. The bot would be
   responsible for accepting dates, and maybe writing them to a file (serializing them?)
3. other simple programs. Upcoming events? game news, maybe via a Twitter account?
4. "simulate internet trouble" mute/deafen members on current call?
